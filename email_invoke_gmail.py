    Usage:            This script is invoked when the RPi4 Model B detects a signal on its GPIO port 17. 
    
    Requirements:     - Python 3.x
                      - Runs on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
    
    Notes:            - This script is triggered when the tunnel powers on.
                      - It sends a no-reply email via noreply-bwt-poweron@purdue.edu
                      - Ensure SMTP credentials and system permissions are configured properly.
