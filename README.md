Autostart function for RPi: 

https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=294014

This program starts up when Raspberry Pi is powered on, which initiates the start_bwt.py script. Once the power is detected on the specific GPIO pins
the RPi sends out an email with the date and time of the instance when the signal is received.
